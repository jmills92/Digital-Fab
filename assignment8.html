            <p>
            </p>
            <p>
            Here is all the documentation for assignment 8!
            </p>

            
            <p>
            For assignment 8 - I would like to create a clock using some of the mixed methods that we've learned throughout the quarter. My goal in creating a clock is to have something that's (almost) useful and realistic in a working context. Additionally, it aligns with the theme of many of the projects this quarter - desk objects - like the Vase, Lamp, Scissors and Copper Box Nicknack.

BREAKDOWN OF THE DESIGN</p>
<p>  The Base: I plan to use Onshape to create a the circular base and to partially cut in the times in roman numerals.
</p>
<p> The hands: I plan on using either onshape or rhino to create the hands of the clock, and then 3D printing them
</p>
<p> The connector: I plan on using one of the plastic connectors that Joshua passed out in class to combine the 3 objects together. This will allow them to form as a movable part (although  manual)

<p> TIMELINE:
</p>
<p>The Base: 30 minutes in Onshape, 30 minutes for laser cutting - on Acrylic
</p>
<p>The hands: 1 hour in Onshape, (likely several hours) for printing will give myself two days minimum to plan for printing and any snafus.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p> SCHEDULE:
</p>
<p>May 30th - June 1st Cad Modeling in Onshape
</p>
<p> June 2nd-4th - Laser print, 3D print & documentation
</p>
<p> June 5th - Finish documentation
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> MATERIALS:
</p>
<p>Acrylic - sourced from the MILL
</p>
<p> FR1 - sourced by me
</p>
<p> Plastic screw - mahcined part sourced from Joshua (earlier in the quarter)
