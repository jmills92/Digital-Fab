            Here is all the documentation for assignment 2!

              Phase 1: Planning
            </P>
            <p>
              In planning to create a laser cut kit, I did some initial research on Pinterest and Google to find some inspiration.

            <p>
            Next, I began building out vector representations in Adobe Illustrator. After a few iterations of designs in Illustrator I was ready to go to The Mill.

            <p>
            Phase 2: At the Mill
            </p>
            <p>
            Once at the Mill I measured the cardboard with Calipers and printed out a test version, 
            I quickly realized that I would need to rethink the size of the components as they were 
            initially smaller than my finished product, however I was running into durability issues 
            with the slots as they were so close together. I also re-measured my cardboard and made 
            my slots a few cm larger, and this made all the difference.

               Iteration 1
            </p>

            </p>
            <p>
            Iteration 2
            </p>
            <p>

            <p>
            Iteration 3

            <p>

            <p>
</p>
            Phase 3: Printing 
</p>
            <p>
            Next I started printing, and went through a few practice trials....
</p>

</p>
           <p>
           It was during these trials that I adjusted the size of the vectors and re-measured the size of my cardboard.

         And Voila! A cardboard vase
