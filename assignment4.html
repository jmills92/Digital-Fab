            Here is all the documentation for assignment 4!

              Phase 1: Planning
            </P>
            <p> For this week's assignment, my intention was to keep my overall design and 3d fabrication as simple as possible, due to  time constraints.
                </p>
            
            <p>
           Over the weekend I was in Arizona, and was inspired by the Breezeblocks (shoutout to Angel!)
            </p>

</p>
<p> I then shifted to Pinterest, and found some inspiration for a Breezeblock lamp    
</p>

            <p>
            My strategy for the design was to build the four sides using cardboard and a laser cutter, and would then create a simple base in the 3D to hold the lamp.
            I  began doing some sketching to map out the laser cut sides.

</p>
            <p> I went through a test print and two other quick rounds of printing to get the size I needed.

Phase 2: 3D Design
</p>
<p>    For the 3D design, I spent time considering how to best (minimally) design a base to ensure I didn't spend too much time in the 3D printer. I consulted with Peter, Leo and eventually Joshua who helped me solidify a design strategy. </p>

</p>
<p> Thanks to Joshua for helping me put my geometry hat on to use Rhino and build out two 3D rectangles within each other, so I could use Boolean difference between the two objects.

<p> I then saved and opened my file in Dremel</P>

</p>
<p>
One hour and seventeen minutes later my base was printed, it's simple thin, and does the job. Surprisingly, I did not run into issues on the 3D (partially because my design was so simple), but am grateful for the break I got, I needed that this week, and it left me optimistic for the next time using the 3D machines.
