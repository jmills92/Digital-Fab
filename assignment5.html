              Phase 1: Planning & Design
            </P>
            <p> To showcase movement, I chose to build a pair of scissors
                </p>
            
            <p>
            I went on Thingiverse and found some inspiration

</p>
</p>
            </P>
            <p>
            My strategy for the design was to use tips from Joshua's tutorial to create the base of the scissor, I used the line tool to build and connect the shape of the scissors and then created curves to soften the edges.

</p>
            <p> I then duplicated the shape, combined them and placed the screw inside. The size of the circle, for the screw measureed at 7.06mm radius.

            <p>
Phase 2: Laser printing
</p>
<p> I chose to laser print on acrylic and leveraged the materials that Joshua had available for the class in The MILL.
</p>
<p> I decided to test the prints on cardboard first, which proved to be worth it. I made some adjustments to the size of the scissors, and then placed the acrylic in. 
<p> Printer settings:</p>
<p> Speed: 10
</p>
<p> Powewr:100
