<p>BREAKDOWN OF THE DESIGN</p>
<p>  The base & hands: I used Onshape to create a 4in diameter clock base. Using Onshape, I created a circle and used the extrude feature so I could the Assemble the components in Onshape to ensure they fit together. After creating the base, I purhcased acrylic from the Mill staff and cut the parts. Unfortunately I was not able to cut in symbols for time on the clock - the MILL was teaching a class for ETCHING on acrylic and was using both machines, therefore was barely able to squeeze in to cut the circular parts.

<p> <b>Designing</b> </p>

<p> The hands: I used Onshape create the hands of the clock, and used a rectangle and circle on Boolean Union to combine the parts and extruded them.

 </p>
 <p> After creating the parts, I combined them in Onshape Assembly to ensure that the parts fit together with the rivet.

 </p>
<p> Once I confirmed that the shapes fit together in their Assembly, I exported the hands file to a Rhino file, and opened up in Rhino and then exported to STL (I did this because I was having issues uploading my Onshape file directly to the Dremel Digilab printer, and Hannah gave me this tip)
</p>
<p> <b> 3D printing:</b>
</p>
<p>Once at the printer, I loaded the Filamnet and started my file (thanks Kira for the guidance), after about 12 minutes my prints were done!

</p>        
<p><b>Combining the parts: </b>
</p>
<p>Next I planned to combine the parts with the Rivet and I knew that this part could go either way... luckily! Everything fit first try, and I was pleasantly surprised. ðŸ˜²
